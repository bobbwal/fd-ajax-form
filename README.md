Foundation-4.3.2 & abide.js


[Use this version of abide.js] (https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/c169e13bdd8abf02eb1ff98def6209643585c858/js/foundation/foundation.abide.js)


The current version of abide.js refreshes on success. This issue has been addressed but doesn't appear to be included in the latest version of Foundation.
